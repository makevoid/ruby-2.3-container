# ruby-2.3-container

Fork of the original ruby 2.3 container from DockerHub ( https://github.com/docker-library/ruby/blob/9c296b2ed4e76d6fd399974545a63d410ade0160/2.3/Dockerfile )

Use Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) instead of Debian Jessie (8.4)

Note: I try to use Debian Jessie as much as I can but I found that most projects/libraries are slightly easier to build on Ubuntu, that's why I had to create this container as a base
